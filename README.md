## Version:
1.0.0

## Tools:
Javascript, React, Cocktail Database, MongoDB Atlas, Auth0, Node.js, Express.js, Netlify.com, Render.com

## Description:
This website allows users to search the [Cocktail Database](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) by drink name, by alcohol, or by ingredient. The user can save and edit results for later. 

## Warning:
Please not that because this is hosted on a free site that the server takes a few minutes to spin up if the website hasn't been visited in the last few hours. Please not that it does work but is hosted on a free service. I will transition it over to a paid service soon and also optimize it for mobile. All good things for version 2.0.0

## Why:
What, I mean who doesn't want a cocktail website? Okay, selfishly Jacob undertook this small personal project as a means to brush up on is React and Javascript skills while he is preparing for his Python bootcamp. Send him a message wishing him well.
